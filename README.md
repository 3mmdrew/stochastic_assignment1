## Repository Structure

### Files
1. **`Assignment 1 - MANDELBROT.pdf`**  
   A detailed description of the assignment. This document outlines the objectives, tasks, and evaluation criteria for the assignment related to the Mandelbrot set and stochastic methods as recieved from Canvas.

2. **`Stochastic_Assignment1.pdf`**  
   A pdf document of the Jupyter File run that was utilised for the report. These figures should match the ones in the report 1:1. Included as executing the Jupyter file seperately will lead to slightly different results given the stochastic nature of the algorithms.

3. **`Assignment_1_final.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the solution to the assignment. It includes:
   - Python code for generating and analyzing the Mandelbrot set.
   - Different stochastic methods applied to solve specific problems.
   - Visualizations and explanations of the results.

4. **`LICENSE`**  
   Specifies the licensing terms for using and distributing this repository's contents (MIT License). Refer to this file for legal details.

5. **`README.md`**  
   The file you are currently reading. Provides an overview and instructions for the repository.
